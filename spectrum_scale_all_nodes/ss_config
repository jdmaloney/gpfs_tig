## Variable Descriptions ##
## cluster --> The pretty name of your cluster; can be what you want doesn't have to be official name of Spectrum Scale Cluster; metrics are tagged with this string so multiple clusters can be tracked

## fs --> Space sperated list of file systems; will be read in as an array so that, where relevant, per-file system metrics are gathered

## paths --> Space separated list of paths to run "ls" on to gather the time it takes from that machine's perspective

## files --> Space separated list of files to run "stat" on to gather the time it takes from that machine's perspective

## check_file --> Path to file (**Beneath the mount point**) to check on every file system to ensure mount presensce is healthy; see usage in ss_health.sh.  At NCSA for example we place a hidden file named .SETcheck in the top level of every file system
